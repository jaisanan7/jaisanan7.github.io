        <h2>Understanding the Impact of Food Waste</h2>
        <p>Food wastage is a massive yet often overlooked problem, silently wreaking havoc on our environment and economy. Every year, billions of pounds of perfectly good food are tossed into landfills, where they rot and release harmful greenhouse gases. This waste begins from the farm and extends to our kitchens, costing billions and contributing to resource depletion. Shockingly, while a significant portion of the population faces hunger, vast amounts of food are left to spoil. The urgency to address this issue is clear: we need a global shift in how we value and manage our food supply.</p>
